1. Download OpenSesame from here: https://osdoc.cogsci.nl/
2. When installed open the opensesame file from the experiment folder
3. Rename the folder in setup to the folder where you python code is
4. Test if PyAudio is installed by typing "import pyaudio" in the console
5. If no pyaudio errors nice. Continue at step 12
6. Else: 
7. Go to the the Folder of OpenSesame (probably in your program files). Go to the share folder
8. Create 2 folders. One named "PyAudio" and one "PortAudio"
9. Look for a file named pyaudio.py on your pc and copy this file to the PyAudio folder you just created
10. Do the same for portaudio but copy it to the PortAudio folder. For me the file was named this "_portaudio.cp37-win_amd64"
11. Test if PyAudio works by typing "import pyaudio" into the OpenSesame console 
12. Try running it with the blue arrows 
13. If pvporcupine is not installed go to the opensesame console and type !pip install pvporcupine
14. It should work now, if not, call/whatsapp me (Lizzy)
