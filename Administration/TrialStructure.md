Alternative approaches and parameters which were evaluated, but not used, are indicated in **bold**.

1. End, thank you

Each section is announced, that is, it is clear to the participant that the previous section has ended.\
**Alternative:** Blocks split and intertwined, e.g. interface 1, interface 2, interface 1, interface 2, etc.

## Block overview
Block interface type is balanced over the total amount of participants, that is, even participant numbers start with the Gestural block, followed by the Speech block, vice versa for the odd participant numbers.

A block consists out of **10** trials. After each trial, a short pause (inter-trial-interval) is introduced of **5** seconds.\
**Alternative:** if the number of trials is increased, a longer pause could be introduced after every **5** trials.

## Trial overview
A trial has an associated dance move sequence consisting of 4 dance moves, randomly drawn from the set of 6 possible dance moves, in a set order.
A dance move instruction is visually communicated by displaying an image of the associated pose, captioned with the associated keyword.

### Instruction display
Always display a fixed row of all 6 possible dance instructions. Indicate per trial the currently active instructions by adding their order (e.g. "1", "2", etc.) underneath.\
**Alternative 1:** Display instructions before the intended execution time, one at a time. This would exclude any memory task involvement.\
**Alternative 2:** Indicate per trial the currently active instructions by displaying them left to right in order.

### Instruction timing
Perform the instructions with necessary intervals for recognition in between. Whether Nao is listening or watching is indicated with a symbol. While the symbol is displayed Nao listens/ watches until a pose is recognised and will perform this pose immediately and thus stop watching or listening until the pose is finished.

**Alternative:** Use a simple melody and instruct participants to give each instruction at the start of a musical sentence, spacing the recognition.
1. Will the Nao's dance moves be equally long? Will the dance moves be longer, shorter, or equal to the time of a musical sentence?
1. Is the time until recognition measured from the distance to the closest start of the musical sentence?

### Inter-trial interval
The Nao will adopt an 'idle' pose for **5** seconds. During this time, the instruction display will disappear.
**Alternative:** In the case of changing only the displayed order (alternative 2 of instruction display), only the order indications disappear.

## Practise overview
The practise block serves to familiarise the participant with the experiment interaction.
It will consist out of **3** trials per interface type, therefore **6** in total.
The used dance sequences are fixed and together introduce all possible dance moves per interface.

**Alternative:** Enforce repetition of trials until **2** consecutive trials are completed without mistake.

## Break overview
During a break, the screen is replaced by an announcement of that break including its time.
During the last **10** seconds, an additional message is displayed the next section will announce shortly.
The break will then end automatically.

## Questionnaire
The questionnaire will be conducted on a website Google Forms. The participant will be presented with an instruction and a hyperlink to this website.
